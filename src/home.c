/*
We return the home directory without a trailing slash.  Otherwise in bash scripts ~/... will
expand out with two slashes.  Also, if we returned with a trailing slash, then rsync 
would behave differently with ~ (specifying contents of home instead of home itself).

I am not sure if pw_dir has always returned a trailing slash on the home directory, though with
the latest upgrade is the first time I am noticing two slashes in transcripts.

It is an error for pw_dir to be an empty string?  I suppose not, but rather it is assumed
to be the root of the file system?  Perhaps that is why they added the slash, to make
that clear.
