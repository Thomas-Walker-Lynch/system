## Install

run the makefile in src/home, mv the resulting executables to /usr/local/bin

> cp Z /usr/local/bin
> cd src/home
> make
> chmod go-w,go+rx home user
> mv home user /usr/local/bin
> cd /usr/local/bin
> sudo chown root:root Z user home

The last step is important so that the scripts do not get modified.


*** home 

home directory from /etc/passwd

Put this at the top of your home protected script:

Set HOME=`/usr/local/bin/home`

*** user

username from /etc/passwd


*** Z
creates timestamps

‘Z’ is the conventional abreviation for UTC time, used by ISO 8601, and in radio communications. (Z comes from 'zero meridian'.  
It is also called ‘Zulu Time’ because ‘Zulu’ is the phonetic for the letter ‘Z’.)

*** Encrypt/Decrypt
A couple of Nautilus scripts in Pythom for encrypting and decrypting files.  These could be improved to work on directories and large files.
