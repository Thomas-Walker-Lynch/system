Some local customization stuff I add to new installs.

*** home 
C program to get the home directory from etc/password.  Used to protect scripts from the HOME envrionment variable being 
changed by a caller.  

An admin should change its ownership to root and install it in `/usr/local/bin`.  Scripts should refer to it through
is full path, so that another home script does not get picked up.

Put this at the top of your home protected script:

Set HOME=`/usr/local/bin/home`

*** Z

‘Z’ is the conventional abreviation for UTC time, used by ISO 8601, and in radio communications. (Z comes from 'zero meridian'.  
It is also called ‘Zulu Time’ because ‘Zulu’ is the phonetic for the letter ‘Z’.)

Scripts in `project-share` make use of this.  

An admin should change its ownership to root and install it in `/usr/local/bin`.  Scripts should refer to it through
its full path, so that another Z script does not get picked up. 


*** Encrypt/Decrypt
A couple of Nautilus scripts in Pythom for encrypting and decrypting files.  These could be improved to work on directories and large files.
