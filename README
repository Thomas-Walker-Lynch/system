Some local customization stuff I add to new installs.

*** home 
simple C program to get the home directory from etc/password.  Used to protect scripts from the HOME envrionment variable being 
changed by a caller.  



Put this at the top of your home protected script:

Set HOME=`/usr/local/bin/home`

*** Z

‘Z’ is the conventional abreviation for UTC time, used by ISO 8601, and in radio communications. (Z comes from 'zero meridian'.  
It is also called ‘Zulu Time’ because ‘Zulu’ is the phonetic for the letter ‘Z’.)

Scripts in `project-share` make use of this.  

An admin should change its ownership to root and install it in `/usr/local/bin`.  Scripts should refer to it through
is full path, so that another Z script does not get picked up. 



## About the `home` script



`home` is binary executable for getting the user's home directory from `/etc/passwd`.

This is used for security reasons in bash scripts, because `$HOME` is inherited 

from the environment and thus might not be the home directory.



The source and makefile for building home are in `project-share/src/home`.  However an admin needs

to install this program.  If the program is owned by the same user it is used by, then it

might be overwritten to give different answers.



To use `home` place it at the top of your script and overwrite the `HOME` variable

from the environment. Something like: `HOME=$(/usr/local/bin/home)`.


ISO8601 standard time in the UTC time zone.  Used for time stamps.  Good to include in prompts when the transcript is to be saved.

*** Encrypt/Decrypt
A couple of Nautilus scripts in Pythom for encrypting and decrypting files.  These could be improved to work on directories and large files.
