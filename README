Some local customization stuff I add to new installs.

*** home 
simple C program to get the home directory from etc/password.  Used to protect scripts from the HOME envrionment variable.  
Set HOME=`/usr/local/bin/home` at the top of the script.

*** Z
ISO8601 standard time in the UTC time zone.  Used for time stamps.  Good to include in prompts when the transcript is to be saved.

*** Encrypt/Decrypt
A couple of Nautilus scripts in Pythom for encrypting and decrypting files.  These could be improved to work on directories and large files.
